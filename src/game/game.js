// The game loop should set up a new game by creating Players and Gameboards.
// For now just populate each Gameboard with predetermined coordinates.
// You can implement a system for allowing players to place their ships later
// You should display both the playerâ€™s boards and render them using information from the Gameboard class.
// You need methods to render the gameboards and to take user input for attacking.
// For attacks, let the user click on a coordinate in the enemy Gameboard
