# Jana's Battleship Game 

## Project's Scope 

![My BattleShip Project Tests](src/assets/Inder/my-unit-tests.png)

- The scope of this project was to build the Battleship game only throught **Test Driven Development**.
- It was unusual at first to write the **Unit Testing** and then start writing the code to make it pass, but it was a really fun and enjoyable experience in the end!
- I worked with Classes again for Ship/Player/Gameboard/AI constructors, and all the game checking logic happens inside of the Classes.
- After finishing the App, I learned how to manipulate the DOM to creaate the **User Interface**.
